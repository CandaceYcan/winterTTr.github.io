Just register a new domain name from [godaddy](http://godaddy.com), so this blog will use this new domain name as long as I can.

I have to say that the `git hub page custom domain manual` is really unclear. And thanks for that someone could give more detail.

About how to setup godaddy, here is good [reference article](http://andrewsturges.com/blog/jekyll/tutorial/2014/11/06/github-and-godaddy.html).

Done~~

**Let's blog~~!**
