Let's have a new start.

<!--more-->

## Before

It is a long time, I do not write something. In fact, there is always something that feels not very satisfied when writing down something new on web. Because I need to spend too much time on formatting things. Fonts, title, format, bullet and etc, I cannot focus on writing.


## Now

Markdown is a really good choice now.

Meanwhile, [hexo](https://hexo.io) is really a good framework to start from scratch again.

Comparing with [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) and github page from raw, I think the hexo is better and more easy.


Here, I want to thanks to the [Next](https://github.com/iissnan/hexo-theme-next) theme for hex, it is really a well prepared theme and support many things which may need U to spend a lot of times to config. Thanks again.


## Next

Let's start again.
